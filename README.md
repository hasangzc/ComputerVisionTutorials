ComputerVisionTutorials w/ opencv and mediapipe

MediaPipe is a graph-based framework for building multimodal (video, audio, and sensor) applied machine learning pipelines. 

OpenCV stands for Open Source Computer Vision. To put it simply, it is a library used for image processing. In fact, it is a huge open-source library used for computer vision applications, in areas powered by Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning algorithms, and for completing tasks that need image processing. As a result, it assumes significance today in real-time operations in todayâ€™s systems. Using OpenCV, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.
